(These are just notes for myself as I'll otherwise forget. Feel free to ignore.)

Build Notes:

* Build dav1d
  * meson --default-library=static --buildtype release ..
  * ninja && ninja install

* Make Xcode project
  * cmake -G Xcode -DCOLORIST_AVIF_ONLY_DAV1D=1 ..
  * open vantage.xcodeproj
* Symlink /usr/local/libdav1d.a into appropriate Debug/Release dirs in build dir
* Hook up AppIcon in General tab (TODO: figure out why this isn't automatic)
* Make sure codesigning is setup right

Xcode Notes:

To hook up a new menu / keybind:

* Add new handler to AppDelegate
  * (compile?)
* Add new menu to Storyboard menu with keybind
* Ctrl+drag new menu to first responder icon (delegate) above, select new handler
* respond to fired event in Renderer (or elsewhere)

To make a Release build:

* Make a new Scheme, point at Vantage, name it Vantage Release
* Change everything in there to Release, remove debug flag
* Build
* sudo pip3 install dmgbuild
* Run in build.vantage/Release dir:
  * coffee /path/to/vantageSource/src/osx/package/package.coffee
